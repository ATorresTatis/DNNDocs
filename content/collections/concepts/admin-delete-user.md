 **NOTE:** Deletion simply makes the account unavailable and revokes user-specific permissions. You must also remove the user from assigned roles to revoke role-based permissions.

 ## What to do next ##
 (Optional) You can purge the user account(s) if you want to permanently delete the user account and its associated information.

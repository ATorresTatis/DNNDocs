# DNN Architecture

DNN is built on the Microsoft web stack. In the DNN Platform architecture, multiple sites can be created on top of a basic web application framework. Each site consists of multiple pages, each containing multiple mini-applications called modules that provide specific functionalities such as e-commerce. These modules may appear on multiple pages of the same or different sites.

### DNN Web Application Framework ###
The DNN web application framework can be extended in many ways. You can build custom modules on top of it, as well as extensions of many kinds. DNN providers, for example, are specific extensions that replace existing functionality in the core solution. The web application framework provides a solid foundation for all your websites and web application needs and is open for integration with external applications via a service framework.
